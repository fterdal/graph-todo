# GraphTODO

This is a *super simple* Todo list application using Express and GraphQL
(and maybe others as needs arise).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/fterdal/graph-todo
```
2. Install the Packages:
```
cd graph-todo
yarn # This project uses yarn. `npm i` should also work.
```
3. Start the server:
```
yarn start
```


## TODO

1. As an existing user, I should be able to login.
2. As a new user, I should be able to create an account.
3. As a logged-in user, I should be able to
     - create new todoLists
     - add todoTasks to existing todoLists
     - mark todoTasks as complete/uncompleted
